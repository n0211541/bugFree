			<p>My name is Teresa Horton. I began working for Liberty as a contractor in July 2011 and was hired
			in November of 2012.  I worked as a Personal Rater in Production while I earned my Computer Science Degree from SNHU.  
			After that I was promoted to a Business Analyst on the CTI Team.  I have worked in this position for three years.</p>
			<p>On a personal level, I live in Berwick, ME. with my husband of 26 years.  We have five children and two beautiful little granddaughters ages
			two and three years. </p>

			<div class = "content"><h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
			<p>In the past I have run a business and a church.  At one point I worked for a draft horse supply place as a customer service rep.
			While there, I created their tack/book/farrier catalogs.  Later I took a position doing investigations in the fraud unit at the National Visa Center.</P>
			<p>In my spare time, I have run a children's ministry with 30 volunteers underneath me.  I really enjoyed this position which entailed
			curriculum development, volunteer training, scheduling and planning special events such as Trunk or Treat.</p>
